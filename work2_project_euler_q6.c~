//2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

      number *= counter;
    }
  }

   printf("Smallest positive number that can evenly divide all numbers from 1 to 20 is: %d\n", number);
